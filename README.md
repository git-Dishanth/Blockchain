# Blockchain Access Control for Healthcare IoT

## Overview
Developed a blockchain-based access control system for **Healthcare IoT** as part of a team project, focusing on smart contract design and backend integration. It leverages the immutability, transparency, and decentralized nature of blockchain to ensure secure data sharing among patients, doctors, hospitals, and other stakeholders. The system aims to mitigate risks such as unauthorized access, data tampering, and privacy breaches in healthcare IoT networks.

## Features
- **Decentralized Access Control**: Eliminates reliance on centralized authorities.
- **Immutable Audit Trail**: Every access request and transaction is permanently recorded.
- **Smart Contracts**: Automates access permissions and revocations.
- **Fine-Grained Permissions**: Patients can control who accesses their medical data.
- **Scalability**: Designed to integrate with diverse IoT devices in healthcare systems.

## Tech Stack
- **Blockchain Platform**: Ethereum / Hyperledger (depending on implementation)
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity
- **Backend**: Python / Node.js
- **Frontend**: React.js (optional UI for visualization)
- **Database**: IPFS / MongoDB (for off-chain storage)


## Installation & Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Vidyadharlolla/Blockchain_access_control_for_healthcare_iot.git
   cd Blockchain_access_control_for_healthcare_iot
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Compile and deploy smart contracts:
   ```bash
   truffle migrate --network development
   ```
4. Run backend server:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
5. (Optional) Launch frontend:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Use Case Example
- A patient uploads medical records to the system.
- Smart contracts enforce access rules (e.g., only their doctor can view).
- Any access attempt is logged on the blockchain for transparency.
- Patients can revoke permissions at any time.

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with **AI-driven anomaly detection** for suspicious access attempts.
- Support for **multi-chain interoperability**.
- Enhanced **user-friendly dashboards** for patients and healthcare providers.
